<b>19A. Disputes Resolutions</b><br>
Generally, transactions are conducted smoothly on Shopclues.com. However there may be some cases where both the Buyers and Sellers may face issues. At Shopclues.com, we have a Dispute Resolution process in order to resolve disputes between Buyers and Sellers.<br><br>

A 'Dispute' can be defined as a disagreement between a Buyer and a Seller in connection with a transaction on the Website. Disputes are filed as a result of a disagreement between the Buyer and the Seller. Disputes arise out of an issue that is raised by either party not being completely satisfied with the resolution of their complaint/issue.<br><br>

It is important that before a Buyer/Seller raises a dispute, they should attempt to solve the issue. Please note that whenever a Buyer raises a dispute, the Seller's payment for that order is put on hold immediately until the issue is resolved.<br><br>

<b>How is a 'dispute' resolved?</b><br>
Whenever there is a disagreement, the Seller and Buyer can write to grievance@apnidukanonline.com in order to raise a dispute. Disputes can be raised at a particular transaction level.<br><br>
In case the Seller rejects the return request of the Buyer, and Buyer raises a dispute, then Shopclues.com will try to mediate and resolve the dispute between both the parties. If the dispute is resolved in favour of the Buyer, a refund is provided once the product is returned to the Seller. If the dispute is settled in favour of the Seller, Buyer is not entitled to any refund.<br><br>
